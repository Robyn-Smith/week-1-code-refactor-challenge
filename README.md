## Description

This project is a code refractor to support a marketing agency website. The website contains information about Search Engine Optimisation, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. It contains header, navigation, aside, section, figure, article and footer elements; which are styled in CSS. Within this code refactor I updated the title, fixed a link, replaced repetitive div tags with semantic elements, added alternative text descriptions to images and updated the CSS acordingly. 

It is important to code refactor to modernise the code. By using semantic elements, the code contains less repetitive div tags and is much easier to read, understand and organise; as there is a clear structure. As a result, this will make the website easier to edit and develop in the future.

Futhermore, this particular code refractor also supports accessibility. This was achieved through the addition of alternative text descriptions on the images. This supports inclusion and diversity for customers that use screen readers. The utilisation of image alternative text is also useful when there are issues with loading the image, for example slow internet connections, as it describes to the users the image they should be able to view when the website is functioning correctly. In addition, alt tags can also support search engine optimisation as the image descriptions can make it easier and more likely for users to find the page; thus promoting buisness and success of the marketing agency. 

Similarly, the updated title is more informative for customers; as it describes and summarises the page. This also supports the probabitlity of the search engine locating the page, which again will promote buisness. The code refractor was also neccessary for the funtionality of the page as the previous version contained a navigation link that was faulty. This issue has been solved with the addition of an id selector. This correction allows the user to easily navigate between different sections on the page.

In summary, the code refactoring supported my learning of:
- accessibility and how to suport this, including the use of alt tags and title descriptions
- semantic elements in html
- updating CSS attributes
- Github repos/ commits / deployment
- how to write a Read me file
- how to organise code
- how to fix navigation links

## Usage

This website is very simple to use. Select one of the nativation links in the top right corner; as seen in image below these are Search Engine Optimisation, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing. This will redirect the user to the according section on the page with further information on the topic.
