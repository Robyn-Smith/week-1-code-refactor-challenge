    <!-- A figure element has been added to replace <div> tags to modernise the code using semantic 
        elements. The image has been removed from CSS and placed into the html so that it is easier 
        to locate and change the image in the future; and so alterantive text can be added incase the 
        image does not load due to internet issues. This also makes the website more inclusive for 
        those using screen readers and supports search engine optimisation. The hero class is referanced 
        and styled in CSS styling sheet.
